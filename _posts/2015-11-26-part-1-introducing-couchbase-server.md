## History of Couchbase
Couchbase emerged out of 2 open source projects, Memcached and CouchDB.

Memcached is the world's most popular open source caching technology used in all major verticals including finance, retail, gaming and social media to name a few. The original key developers of Memcached developed Membase as an enterprise ready Caching and Key Value database. Membase addressed many inherent limitations of Memcached:

1. A consolidated Cache and Key Value database
2. Clustered and distributed from the get-go
3. Replication and Automatic High Availability
4. Autosharding and easy scalability
5. Disk persistence

Membase then evolved into Couchbase by introducing JSON document support. Again, like Memcached, the original developers of CouchDB were responsible for adding JSON document support.

Today, the original engineers of both open source technologies continue to work for Couchbase, adding new innovatives and continously improving performance and scale. Here are some of the key features:

1. An enterprise Caching, Key Value and Document database solution
2. Replication, Ultra high availability (Rack/Zone awareness)
3. Cross data center replication for Disaster recovery
4. ANSI Compliant SQL for JSON documents
5. Geo Spatial Queries
6. Distributed Indexes (Views) and Global secondary indexes
7. Embedded database and Synchronisation platform for offline/online and IOT usecases
8. Full Text Search (developer preview)

Its worth point out that Couchbase is now a completely distinct codebase from Memcached and CouchDB.
